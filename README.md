# Project2

This repository's files and shiny app analyze NFL play-by-play data. Specifically, it looks at plays where a penalty was assessed. Analyses were completed comparing the penalty incidence, and average experience level by categorical variables including: position group, the nature of the penalty(penalty type), conference and team. The app allows the user to subset data based on year, conference, player experience level, and offense/defense. There is a tab for the user to create their own bar plot by selecting different x and y variables. The user also has the ability to download the data from this shiny app. I hope you enjoy!
