# Project2

This repository's files and shiny app analyze NFL play-by-play data. Specifically, it looks at plays where a penalty was assessed. Analyses were completed comparing the penalty incidence, and average experience level by categorical variables including: position group, the nature of the penalty(penalty type), conference and team.
